Introducing scout, an open source browser-based tool that eases the discovery and curation of thematically related and joinable datasets to broaden the application of open data to uncover new insights.

Scout is designed to help surface datasets across governmental Open Data Portals that might have escaped your attention before.

## Contributing

We love all contributions, be it a bug report or feature request via a GitHub issue, or feedback over email

## Roadmap 

We will maintain a 6 month roadmap which you can read here: [roadmap](https://github.com/tsdataclinic/scout/blob/master/Roadmap.md). If you want clarification on the roadmap or have suggestions or other comments, please open an [issue](https://github.com/tsdataclinic/scout/issues).

## Development

If you want to help with the development of scout, you will need to be able to run the code locally. Scout is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and for development we use [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/).

To get started install yarn and then run the following in a terminal:

```bash
yarn
```

Once that is done simply run the folowing to start the development server:

```
yarn start
```
