# Contributing Guidelines

## Naming Branches
Please name all branches with the following format:

```
{type}/{GitHub Issue Number}-{short}-{sentence}
```

Examples:
```
feature/1-Adding-Download-Button
bugfix/2-Fixing-Login-Screen
task/3-Refactoring-API
task/NOISSUE-update-react-version
```

Types: Can be feature, bugfix, or task.
## Naming Commits
Please describe all commits with this format:

{GitHub Issue # or NOISSUE} {Some short description}

Examples:

Issue #3 Add a button
NOISSUE Fix NullPointerException


## Separating Concerns
  - Housekeeping tasks (eg bumping a version of a dependency, adding autogenerated code) should be kept in a separate commit, and preferably in a separate and dedicated PR.

  - Where possible, try to keep pure refactoring (rearranging source code without detectable behavior changes) in a separate commit and PR from other changes. This makes them easier to review.
