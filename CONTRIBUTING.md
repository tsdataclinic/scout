## 1. Reporting a bug

To report a bug please submit an issue using our [Bug template](https://github.com/tsdataclinic/scout/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D).

2. Proposing new features

To propose a new feature please submit a discussion in the [Feature Requests & Ideas](https://github.com/tsdataclinic/scout/discussions/categories/feature-requests-ideas) discussion section. If you see other feature requests there that interest you we encourage you to leave your thoughts!

You don't need to have your idea fully fleshed out, that's what the discussion is for! We can all work together to figure out what the best thing to build is.

3. Submitting feedback and questions

In general, the [discussions](https://github.com/tsdataclinic/scout/discussions) section of the repo is the best place to view announcements, leave feedback, and submit any questions. Go to the appropriate category and start a new discussion, we'd love to hear your thoughts.

Before starting a new discussion please use the search feature to see if someone else has already created one on the same topic. If so, then please leave a comment on the existing discussion rather than starting a new one.

The available discussion sections are:

- Announcements: updates from the project maintainers
- Feature Requests & Ideas: for any ideas you have about the project
- Feedback: for any product feedback or general thoughts
- Polls: any polls from the maintainers about features or product direction
- Q&A: for any questions about the product, features, or codebase

4. Contributing to the codebase

If you'd like to contribute to the codebase then you will first need to [set up the project locally](https://github.com/tsdataclinic/scout#3-developing). Once you have the project running on your local machine then you are ready to start developing.

If you'd like some ideas of where to start then we recommend looking at any issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/tsdataclinic/scout/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [bug](https://github.com/tsdataclinic/scout/labels/bug).

In order to keep some structure to the contribution process, we will not accept contributions for features or bugs that have not been discussed previously in a GitHub issue or discussion. If you have a great idea and really want to see it implemented we really don't want to stop you though! We just ask that you please start a discussion for it first before submitting a pull request, so that we can keep track of it and make sure your idea is aligned with the project's vision and roadmap.

If you have questions about the codebase itself, we recommend submitting a discussion in the [Q&A discussion section](https://github.com/tsdataclinic/scout/discussions/categories/q-a).

5. Submitting pull requests

All development should be done in a separate branch, and each pull request should represent a single discrete feature. Well-constrained updates rather than all-encompassing changes are easier to review and much more likely to be incorporated into the codebase.

Make sure your pull request is configured to merge to the `main` branch. This guidance likely change once a `develop` branch is set up.

Add @jps327 as the reviewer and please make sure you fill out all sections of the pull request template. Any pull requests with missing information will not be accepted.
